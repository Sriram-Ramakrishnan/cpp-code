/**
Notes:

 this - it is a pointer which refers to the current object

Example:
In a class:

void setX(int x){
this->x = x;}


Static keyword:

Using scope resolution operator
U can use it anywhere

Suppose if we declare a static variable:
static int variable;

int class::variable = 0;

Same goes for functions
Just have to declare in the same manner

Advantage is this allows u to work outside of a class
